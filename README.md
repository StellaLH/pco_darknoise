# pco_darknoise
When the PCO is covered up, the pixels still pick up back gruond noise (or dark noise). For each pixel, this was was collected and annalysed, with results stored as matrices of mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum pixel values over a range of exposure times, file sizes and pixel rates.

# noise_analysis.py

Saves mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum pixel values for a range of exposure times, pixel rates and file sizes.

# noise_analysis2.py

Saves mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum pixel values for a single exposure time over a range of pixel rates and file sizes.

# pixel_statistics.py

input the statistic, frame length, pixel rate, exposure time you desire, into the function, and the statistics of all pixel will return as a matrix.
